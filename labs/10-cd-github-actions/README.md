# Module 10 Lab — Continuous Delivery and Deployment

## Objective
Extend the CI workflow from Module 09 to build a Docker image, push it to GitHub Container
Registry (GHCR), and deploy it to a Linux server using Docker Compose — triggered automatically
on every push to `main`.

## Prerequisites
- Module 09 lab completed (stocks app pushed to GitHub with a passing CI workflow)
- A Dockerfile in the repository root (from Module 08)
- `docker-compose.yml` provided in this folder — copy it to your repository root
- A Linux VM with Docker installed and your SSH public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- Your Linux VM's IP address, SSH username, and private key to hand

## What is provided
- `docker-compose.yml` — defines the `mysql` and `stock-app` services. Copy this to the
  root of your stock-tracker repository.
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` — a workflow template with TODO stubs for you to complete.

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Prepare the Linux VM
SSH into your Linux VM and verify Docker and Docker Compose are available:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Create the deployment directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/stock-app
```

Log out.

---

### Step 2 — Add the provided files to your repository
Copy both files into your stock-tracker repository:

- `docker-compose.yml` → root of the repository
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` → `.github/workflows/cd.yml`

---

### Step 3 — Make the GHCR package public
After your first push, GitHub creates a private package by default. Make it public so the
Linux VM can pull the image without authentication:

1. Go to your GitHub profile > **Packages**
2. Click your `stock-app` package
3. Package settings > Change visibility > **Public**

*(Alternatively, add a `docker login ghcr.io` step in the deploy SSH script — see Key Questions.)*

---

### Step 4 — Create repository secrets
Go to your GitHub repository > **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** >
**New repository secret** and add these three secrets:

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `DEPLOY_HOST` | IP address of your Linux VM |
| `DEPLOY_USER` | Your SSH username on the VM (e.g. `ubuntu`) |
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` | The full contents of your SSH private key file |

To copy your private key contents:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
Copy everything including the `-----BEGIN` and `-----END` lines.

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically — you do not need to create it.

---

### Step 5 — Complete the CD workflow
Open `.github/workflows/cd.yml` and complete the TODOs:

```yaml
name: CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # TODO 1: Add permissions to allow pushing packages to GHCR
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: ???

    outputs:
      image: ${{ steps.image-name.outputs.image }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout source
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: maven

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn -B package -DskipTests

      # TODO 2: Add a step to run the tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: ???

      - name: Derive lowercase image name
        id: image-name
        run: |
          IMAGE="ghcr.io/$(echo '${{ github.repository }}' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'):${{ github.sha }}"
          echo "image=$IMAGE" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

      # TODO 3: Log in to GHCR using docker/login-action@v3
      #         registry: ghcr.io
      #         username: ${{ github.actor }}
      #         password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Log in to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: ???
        with:
          registry: ???
          username: ???
          password: ???

      # TODO 4: Build and push the image using docker/build-push-action@v5
      #         context: .   push: true
      #         tags: ${{ steps.image-name.outputs.image }}
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: ???
        with:
          context: .
          push: ???
          tags: |
            ???
            ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/stock-app:latest

  deploy:
    # TODO 5: Make this job depend on build-and-push succeeding
    needs: ???
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout source
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # TODO 6: Copy docker-compose.yml to ~/stock-app/ on the server
      #         Use appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
      #         host, username, key come from secrets
      - name: Copy docker-compose.yml to server
        uses: appleboy/scp-action@v0.1.7
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.??? }}
          username: ${{ secrets.??? }}
          key: ${{ secrets.??? }}
          source: docker-compose.yml
          target: ~/stock-app/

      # TODO 7: SSH to the server and run:
      #           cd ~/stock-app
      #           echo "STOCK_APP_IMAGE=<image>" > .env
      #           docker compose pull
      #           docker compose up -d
      #           docker compose ps
      - name: Deploy via SSH
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            cd ~/stock-app
            echo "STOCK_APP_IMAGE=${{ needs.build-and-push.outputs.image }}" > .env
            docker compose ???
            docker compose ???
            docker compose ps
```

---

### Step 6 — Push and watch the pipeline run
Commit everything and push:

```bash
git add docker-compose.yml .github/workflows/cd.yml
git commit -m "Add CD workflow and docker-compose"
git push
```

Go to the **Actions** tab on GitHub. You should see two jobs run in sequence:
1. `build-and-push` — builds the JAR, runs tests, pushes to GHCR
2. `deploy` — copies the compose file, SSHs to the server, brings up the app

---

### Step 7 — Verify the deployment
Once the pipeline is green, open `http://YOUR-VM-IP:8080` in a browser.

You should see the Stock Tracker frontend loading data from the API.

On the Linux VM, verify the containers are running:

```bash
docker compose -f ~/stock-app/docker-compose.yml ps
docker compose -f ~/stock-app/docker-compose.yml logs stock-app
```

---

### Step 8 — Deploy a change end-to-end
Make a visible change — for example, add a new stock to the seed data in `StockApplication.java`:

```java
service.addStock(new Stock(null, "SHEL", "Shell PLC", "Energy", "LSE"));
```

Commit and push. Watch the full pipeline run. After it completes, refresh the browser —
the new stock should appear without any manual steps on the server.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- A push to `main` triggers both jobs automatically
- The `deploy` job only runs if `build-and-push` succeeds
- The Docker image appears in your GitHub Packages
- `http://YOUR-VM-IP:8080` serves the stock tracker frontend
- A code change pushed to `main` is live on the server after the pipeline completes
- MySQL data persists across deployments (the `mysql-data` volume is not removed)

## Key Questions
1. Why does the `deploy` job need `needs: build-and-push`? What would happen without it?
2. Why do we tag images with the git commit SHA rather than always using `:latest`?
3. What is the purpose of `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` in `docker-compose.yml`?
4. Why does a `docker compose up -d` not restart the MySQL container on each deployment?
5. How would you authenticate the Linux VM to pull from a private GHCR package?
6. What is the `mysql-data` volume, and what happens to the database if you run `docker compose down -v`?
